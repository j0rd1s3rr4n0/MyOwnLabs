##### General Rules and Instructions

- When you start the CTF, 45 minutes will be alloted to complete the challenges.
- Each question has some points to it depending upon the difficulty. Taking a hint will deduce 10% of the points associated with the question.
- There is no particular order of solving the questions.
- Judging of the round will be based on two parameters. The first is the score of the team and second is the time required.
- Ranks can be viewed on the leaderboard page. The leaderboard time is updated everytime a submission is made.
- Flags found are of the format CTF{something_cool}. or flag{something_cool}. Some of the files may contain just the inner text within the brackets. Make sure you submit it in the format specified. Flag text is not case sensitive.
- This is a competitive environment with the aim of learning cyber security and ethical hacking. Please do not share the flags & solutions with others.
- Internet access is granted. Feel free to explore and read about the concept behind the problem.
